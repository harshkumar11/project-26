/*according to various Internet sources, 
including these by Mental_Floss and io9, velvet 
cakes of the past were made with baking soda and 
either vinegar or buttermilk. When the baking soda
 combined with either of these two ingredients, it 
would bubble up and cause the cake to have a fluffy and smooth texture.*/

TIP #1 ON HOW TO MAKE BOX MIX TASTE HOMEMADE
Start with the best box mix possible. I’m a Duncan Hines girl myself. The price is a little bit
 more expensive than the super cheap box mix but I believe you get what you pay for. Not to mention Duncan 
 Hines are often on sale so stock up on your top flavors and enjoy all the funny looks you’ll get at check out. 
the best brand for doctored box mix recipes
My favorite Duncan Hines box mix flavors are Red Velvet, Triple Chocolate, 
White Cake (for making WASC) and strawberry. Sometime I can’t find duncan hines
 strawberry so I’ll go with Betty Crocker. These are all recipes that take a ton of time to make from scratch and are the most requested flavors from my clients. For the chocolate version of this recipe check out my Chocolate WASC Recipe











TIP #2 ON HOW TO MAKE BOX MIX TASTE HOMEMADE
Usually a box mix has the following ingredients listed on the back that they want you 
to add. Eggs, water and oil. This is smart on their end because pretty much everyone 
has these ingredients on hand already.
he thing about these ingredients though, they don’t add much to
 the cake as far as flavor goes. 
replace water with milk for more flavor and moisture. If you’re making red
 velvet you can use buttermilk. 
Replace the oil with melted butter for more flavor and
 homemade texture
For chocolate cakes, try replacing the water with cooled coffee. 
The coffee intensifies the chocolate flavor! Get the recipe Chocolate WASC



TIP #3 ON HOW TO MAKE BOX MIX TASTE HOMEMADE
You might have heard of WASC (white almond sour cream cake) 
and wondered what it is. It’s basically the best doctored box mix recipe of all time. The taste, 
texture and flavor of this cake is TO DIE FOR. It’s no wonder its the recipe of choice when you need a 
perfect white cake for so many bakers.

How to make WASC

Start with one box of white Duncan Hines mix
Add in one cup of AP flour
1 cup of granulated sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup sour cream   
1/2 cup melted butter  
1 cup of water or milk  
4 egg whites 
1 tsp almond extract  
Place all of your ingredients into the bowl of your stand
 mixer (or you can mix by hand) and stir on low to combine until just moistened.
  Then bump up to medium speed and mix for 2 minutes to develop the texture and structure of the cake. 

Pour your batter into your prepared pans. I like to use a homemade pan
 release (cake goop). The best homemade pan release there is! Bake at 350ºF 
 for 35-40 minutes until a toothpick comes out from the center cleanly. 

Let cool completely before decorating. For more info on 
decorating your first cake, check out my free training on how to make your first cake. 

TIP #4 ON HOW TO MAKE BOX MIX TASTE HOMEMADE
Make your buttercream from scratch. I know this sounds 
counter-intuitive because we’re trying to go for easy here. Maybe you’ve never made homemade 
buttercream before and you’re intimidated. Well let me put your mind at ease. 

My easy buttercream recipe is so simple, it may as well be cheating. Simply place 
all your ingredients in a bowl, whip it until it’s light and fluffy. Then let it mix on
 low with the paddle attachment for 10 minutes to get rid of bubbles.
